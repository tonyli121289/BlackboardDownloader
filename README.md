# CUHK Lecture Note downloader

This is a tool for downloading course materials from the Blackboard system (tested in CUHK Blackboard only)

ChromeDriver is used, if the program is not working, you may need to download the latest driver from https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads

A Google Chrome window will be prompted for login to the Blackboard, if you don't want to typing your password everytime, you can save your Login ID and OnePass Password to ```login.txt``` (Login ID in the first line and OnePass Password in the second line)
